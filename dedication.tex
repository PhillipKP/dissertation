For my wife. We moved from city to city. You stuck with me through the highs and lows. You cooked dinner for me when I came home from a long day. You did the chores so I could concentrate on research. You acted as both mother and father to our son while I wrote. You believed in me even when I did not. You sacrificed your dreams and goals so I could accomplish mine.

You're the real Ph.D.
