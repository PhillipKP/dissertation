\chapter{Formalism}\label{chap:Formalism}

This chapter introduces the reader to the more rigorous concepts and mathematical background that will required to fully understand the material presented in the later chapters of this dissertation. 

A rigorous discussion of multiplexing and signal-to-noise ratio will be discussed, as well are various coding schemes used in various notable computational sensors as well as the ones in this disseration. 

Since the \gls{afssi-c} relies on a variation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a Bayesian algorithm for coding design we will discuss some of the fundamental of Bayesian probability and the Log-Likelihood Ratios.

\subsection{The Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem}

The Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem states one must sample a signal with a sampling rate that is at least twice the maximum frequency of the signal to prevent aliasing \cite{shannon1949communication}.
